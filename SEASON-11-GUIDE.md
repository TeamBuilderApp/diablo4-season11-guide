# Diablo IV — Season 11 Guide

Welcome to the community-maintained Season 11 guide for Diablo IV. This document is intended to give new and returning players a practical starting point for Season 11: high-level notes about what's important this season, efficient leveling, endgame priorities, and a space for class-specific build recommendations.

> Note: This guide is meant to be a living document. If you notice anything out-of-date with the latest patch notes or balance changes, please open a PR to update the relevant section.

## Quick TL;DR
- Focus on efficient leveling first (world events, side quests, zone progression)
- Prioritize quality-of-life progression to reach endgame: stash, inventory space, and a suitable core build
- For endgame, target the Season 11 thematic objectives (see season notes below) and farm the strongest altars/activities listed
- Share class-specific builds and guides in this repo so players can pick a tested template

## What to expect in Season 11
- This repo does not hard-code patch numbers. Replace this section with concrete Season 11 patch highlights (new content, major balance changes, and any season-exclusive mechanics) when available.

### Recommended: Keep a short changelog here
- Patch / date — short notes on big changes that affect builds or progression

## Efficient leveling (0–50)
1. Use zone story and side quests to get experience and gear upgrades — they give reliable XP and useful early gear.
2. Complete world events and strongholds; these provide experience, currency, and legendary gear opportunities.
3. Prioritize skills that let you clear groups quickly and move fast (mobility/travel skills). Leveling speed > perfect optimization.
4. Use crafting for basic upgrades but avoid over-investing until you hit level cap.

## Reaching the endgame (50+)
- Unlock shared stash and expand it as soon as possible to store gear and optimization items.
- Start building a reliable core build first that is easy to play and resilient.
- Use map/area modifiers knowledge to choose where to farm (areas with high density and short clear time).

## Progression roadmap for Season 11
1. Level to cap while doing main story + world objectives.
2. Start farming for a core legendary set/weapons that enable your chosen build.
3. Begin participating in seasonal activities (seasonal quests, special dungeons, or battlegrounds) to claim seasonal rewards.
4. Optimize Paragon (or similar late-game progression systems) and socket/enchants.

## General build tips
- Prioritize survivability first, then sustained damage. You can't optimize DPS if you die repeatedly.
- Learn which affixes to reroll on your main gear pieces (main stat, damage type multiplier, cooldown reduction, resource cost reduction, life on hit, and damage avoidance modifiers).
- Consider two-gear sets: a levelling set (fast clear) and a boss set (single-target 1v1).

## Group play tips
- Communicate roles (pull, CC, single-target DPS), keep builds complementary (support vs. burst), and distribute crafting mats and key items.
- Share best-in-slot materials and socket recipes in the repository for teammates to consult.

## Endgame activities
- Short clears for material farming (timed runs, dens)
- Long clears for high-tier rewards (nightmares, high-difficulty dungeons, world bosses)
- Seasonal event activities — follow the season objectives and optimize routes
